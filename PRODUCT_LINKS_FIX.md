# Product Links Fix in Reminder Emails

## Issue Fixed
**Incorrect Product Links in Reminder Emails**

### Problem
The reminder emails were generating product links with the wrong format:
- **Incorrect**: `http://localhost:3000/products/68705e869ac3a2f05d8e4099`
- **Correct**: `http://localhost:3000/productDetail/68705e869ac3a2f05d8e4099`

### Root Cause
In the `productRecommendation.js` file, the link generation was using `/products/` instead of `/productDetail/`:

```javascript
// Before: Wrong route
link: `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/products/${product._id}`,

// After: Correct route
link: `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/productDetail/${product._id}`,
```

### Files Modified

1. **backend/utils/productRecommendation.js**
   - Fixed main product recommendations link generation
   - Fixed fallback product link generation

2. **backend/utils/reminderMail.js** 
   - Updated "Explore More Gifts" button to link to `/allProducts` instead of `/products`

### Changes Made

#### Product Detail Links
```javascript
// Fixed in productRecommendation.js line ~80
link: `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/productDetail/${product._id}`,

// Fixed fallback product link ~line 103
link: `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/productDetail/${fallbackProduct._id}`
```

#### Explore More Gifts Button
```javascript
// Fixed in reminderMail.js
<a href="${process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/allProducts">Explore More Gifts</a>
```

### Frontend Route Structure Confirmed
- ✅ Individual products: `/productDetail/[id]` 
- ✅ All products page: `/allProducts`
- ❌ No `/products/[id]` route exists

### Testing
After this fix:
- ✅ Product links in reminder emails now work correctly
- ✅ Users can click product links and view product details
- ✅ "Explore More Gifts" button takes users to the correct products listing page
- ✅ No more 404 errors from incorrect links

### Impact
- Users clicking product links from reminder emails will now be taken to the correct product detail pages
- Better user experience and potentially higher conversion rates from email recommendations
- Consistent URL structure throughout the application
