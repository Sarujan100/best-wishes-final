# Order Management System Changes Summary

## üîß **Changes Made**

### 1. **All Orders Tab - Show Only Completed Orders**
- **Before**: All orders tab showed orders with any status
- **After**: All orders tab only shows orders with status "delivered" (completed orders)

```jsx
// Updated filter logic
const matchesTab =
  (activeTab === "accepted" && order.status === "processing") ||
  (activeTab === "packed" && order.status === "packing") ||
  (activeTab === "delivery" && order.status === "shipped") ||
  (activeTab === "all" && order.status === "delivered") // Only completed orders
```

### 2. **Removed Toast Notifications - Back to Browser Alerts**
- **Removed**: All `toast.success()`, `toast.error()`, `toast.info()`, `toast.warning()` calls
- **Replaced with**: Standard browser `alert()` dialogs
- **Removed**: Sonner toast imports and Toaster component

## üìã **Updated Functions**

### **acceptOrder()**
```jsx
// Before: toast.success(`Order ${orderId} has been accepted...`)
// After:  alert(`Order ${orderId} has been accepted...`)
```

### **updateOrderToPacking()**
```jsx
// Before: toast.success(`Order ${orderId} moved to packing!...`)
// After:  alert(`Order ${orderId} moved to packing!...`)
```

### **confirmPacked()**
```jsx
// Before: toast.success(`Order ${orderId} has been marked as shipped...`)  
// After:  alert(`Order ${orderId} has been marked as shipped...`)
```

### **markAsDelivered()**
```jsx
// Before: toast.success(`Order ${orderId} has been marked as delivered!`)
// After:  alert(`Order ${orderId} has been marked as delivered!`)
```

### **reduceProductStock()**
```jsx
// Before: toast.warning("Warning: No valid product IDs found...")
// After:  alert("Warning: No valid product IDs found...")
```

### **exportToCSV()**
```jsx
// Before: toast.info("Export CSV is only available on the 'All' tab.")
// After:  alert("Export CSV is only available on the 'All' tab.")
```

## üéØ **Result**

1. **All Orders Tab**: Now displays only completed/delivered orders
2. **User Feedback**: Back to standard browser alert dialogs (no fancy toast notifications)
3. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Still uses modern AlertDialog components for confirmations
4. **Loading States**: Still maintains spinner loading states during operations

## üîç **Tab Behavior**
- **Processing Tab**: Shows orders with status "processing"  
- **Packing Tab**: Shows orders with status "packing"
- **Ready for Delivery Tab**: Shows orders with status "shipped"
- **All Orders Tab**: Shows only orders with status "delivered" ‚úÖ

The system now works exactly as requested - completed orders only in the All tab, and browser alerts instead of toast notifications.
