# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed
1. **Product Creation 401 Unauthorized Error**
2. **Product Deletion 401 Unauthorized Error**

### Problem
Admin components were using native `fetch()` without including authentication credentials, causing 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to perform authenticated operations.

### Root Cause
```javascript
// Before: Missing credentials
const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'DELETE', // or POST/PUT
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
```

The backend routes require authentication for admin operations:
```javascript
// Product routes requiring authentication
router.post("/", isAuthenticated, authorizeRoles('admin', 'inventoryManager'), createProduct);
router.delete("/:id", isAuthenticated, authorizeRoles('admin', 'inventoryManager'), deleteProduct);
router.put("/:id", isAuthenticated, authorizeRoles('admin', 'inventoryManager'), updateProduct);
```

### Solution
Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch requests in admin components:

```javascript
// After: With credentials
const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'DELETE', // or POST/PUT
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  credentials: 'include', // ✅ This sends cookies/authentication tokens
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
```

### Files Modified

1. **ProductForm.jsx** 
   - ✅ Fixed product creation 
   - ✅ Fixed categories loading

2. **ProductDashboard.jsx**
   - ✅ Fixed product deletion

3. **ordermanagment/page.jsx** 
   - ✅ Fixed order fetching (changed `/orders` to `/orders/all`)
   - ✅ Fixed order updates, bulk operations, and deletions

### Public vs Protected Endpoints

**Public Endpoints (no credentials needed):**
- `GET /products` - Get all products
- `GET /categories` - Get all categories  
- `GET /products/:id` - Get single product

**Protected Endpoints (credentials required):**
- `POST /products` - Create product (admin/inventoryManager)
- `PUT /products/:id` - Update product (admin/inventoryManager)  
- `DELETE /products/:id` - Delete product (admin/inventoryManager)
- `GET /orders/all` - Get all orders (admin/inventoryManager)
- `PUT /orders/:id` - Update order (admin/inventoryManager)
- `DELETE /orders/:id` - Delete order (admin/inventoryManager)

### Testing
After these fixes, admin users should be able to:
- ✅ Create new products without 401 errors
- ✅ Delete products without 401 errors  
- ✅ Load categories in product form
- ✅ Manage orders properly
- ✅ Use all admin features with proper authentication

### Note
The rest of the application already uses `axios` with `withCredentials: true` or `fetch` with `credentials: 'include'`. These fixes bring all admin components in line with the application's authentication pattern.

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in → Authentication cookie/token is set
2. Admin operations send `credentials: 'include'` with fetch requests
3. Backend receives authentication cookie and validates user role
4. Operations proceed if user has admin/inventoryManager permissions
